Have the function FirstFactorial(num) take the num parameter being passed and return the factorial of it. 
For example: if num = 4, then your program should return (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 24. 
For the test cases, the range will be between 1 and 18 and the input will always be an integer.

## Factorials can be solved in two ways 
* recursive: This is shorter and cleaner but consume higher energy because all the function calls remain in the stack until the base case is reached.
* iterative: This is lengthier and take less memory
